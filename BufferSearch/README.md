## Vulnerabiliity Analysis Tool 1


One of the main vulnerability that come when detecting buffer overflows is bad functions such as strcpy and sprintf. Another thing I learned is copying that data in fixed buffer.

This project aims at detecting fixed buffers so I can view exactly the places I should look for first. For the time being, this will only be done on open source projects. In the future I can see this expanding into dynamic analysis.

I also think it is beneficial to become a developer of some kind and should really practice my skills in C. Therefore, for most of these projects I will be writing them with C and not with python. While Python is great, I think C is better.

Methodology:
* Utilize regex
* Sequential search through folders in a effective manner.
  * Best approach might be to utilize a stack.
