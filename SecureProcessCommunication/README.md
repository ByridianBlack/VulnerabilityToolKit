## Intro
 
The purpose of this is getting started learning secure interprocess communication steps. Estentially, I want this to be a type of framework that any process can use to communicate
with another and not worry about their communication being leaked. 

For this, I want to utilize Unix domain sockets, a technology that there is little talk about.

I want to use the server client model where each process estentially is a client and communicates through a third party, server. The server is not 
responsible for the actually security, but more so making sure every client
is following the same rules so that information in passed effectivily.

Because of this I will be making a custom format for destination and source
and etc.
